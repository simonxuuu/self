        <p id="description">One of my proudest achievements is co-founding Predictoro, a platform utilizing machine learning to deliver accurate predictions. As the Machine Learning Lead, I'm responsible for the engine that drives our success. It's been an incredible journey witnessing Predictoro grow from a high school project into a thriving platform with a dedicated user base.

        <header id="title">Game Development</header>

        <p id="description">I've always been fascinated by the world of game development. I've created several games as learning resources for others. These projects have allowed me to explore different aspects of game development, from designing game mechanics to implementing complex systems. I'm excited to continue expanding my skills in this area and creating more engaging games. What I am most proud of in my experience with game development is my contribution to an official ROBLOX event as a programmer. This experience reached 3M+ visits, and it was an incredible opportunity to work with a team of talented developers.
